# REValidation

Simple Objective-C object validation.

Currently available default validators:

> * Presence validator
* String length validator
* Email validator

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher / Mac OS X 10.7 or higher
* ARC

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REValidation` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REValidation:

``` bash
pod 'REValidation', '~> 0.1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REValidation` files into your project, and add `#include "REValidation.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
[REValidation registerDefaultValidators];
[REValidation registerDefaultErrorMessages];

NSString *emailString = @"test#@example.com";
NSArray *errors = [REValidation validateObject:emailString name:@"Email" validators:@[ @"presence", @"length(3, 20)", @"email" ]];

for (NSError *error in errors)
    NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.localizedDescription);

// Alternatively you can REValidator instances
//
NSString *testString = @"";
errors = [REValidation validateObject:testString name:@"Test string" validators:@[ [REPresenceValidator validator], [RELengthValidator validatorWithParameters:@{ @"min": @3, @"max": @10} ] ]];

for (NSError *error in errors)
    NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
```
